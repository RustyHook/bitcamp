###Data:

*****************************************************************************
**Register Page
****************************************************************************
The register page is screen the user will see when creating a new account.  They are coming from the Login Screen.

MySQL tables that will be edited:
	username
	password
	first name
	last name
	email
	phone number

Also, record should be assigned a new unique idetifer (most likely called "User ID").

Everytime submit is pressed, the user is assigned the next available User ID
	(e.g. database already contains user 001 and user 002.  New user will be assigned user 003.  Next new user will be assigned user 004... etc)

***********************************************************************************
**Main Page
*********************************************************************************

This is the page that the user will spend most of his or her time in.  Hence "main page".  Inside this screen, the user will be able
to see his list of groups.  He will also be allowed to add new groups from this page.  There are also buttons on the page to access a general settings page and 
a "View Requests Page"

###Visuals:

The top border of window will have a settings button and a view requests button.

In the middle of the window, there will be a scrollable list of groups the user has made
	(e.g. HR, Accounting, IT People)

At the bottom border of the window there will be two buttons named create group and remove group.

If present, clicking on a group button will take user to the Group View page 

-Settings button will take user to settings page

-View Requests will take user to requests page

- Create Group will take user to Create new Group Page

- Remove group will take the user to the remove group page
	options:
		user will stay on same page, and can "delete" the buttons that are there (think Apple iOS and deleting emails0
		user will be directed to a different page and choose which groups to remove (checklist) and come back to Main page where the removed group will be gone.

###Data:

The actual groups will be stored on device.
	Option: groups can be stored as a table on MySQL and queryed from app

This page needs to access whereever the above data is stored and display it on the Main Page.

The Grouplist portion of the main page should be scrollable if the user has more groups than the window can fit.

The settings, view requests, create group, and remove group buttons stay in place even if grouplist is scrollable.
	(i.e. when scrolling thru list, can still access buttons without having to scroll all the way back up or down)

Buttons as described in visual section should be correctly programmed to take user to appropriate pages..

*****************************************************************************************

THis is the page where users create groups.  They add members to group on a different page.

###Visuals
