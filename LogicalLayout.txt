Everytime submit is pressed, the user is assigned the next available User ID
	(e.g. database already contains user 001 and user 002.  New user will be assigned user 003.  Next new user will be assigned user 004... etc)

***********************************************************************************
**Main Page  --> 3
*********************************************************************************

This is the page that the user will spend most of his or her time in.  Hence "main page".  Inside this screen, the user will be able
to see his list of groups.  He will also be allowed to add new groups from this page.  There are also buttons on the page to access a general settings page and 
a "View Requests Page"

###Visuals:

	(e.g. HR, Accounting, IT People)

At the bottom border of the window there will be two buttons named create group and remove group.

If present, clicking on a group button will take user to the Group View page 

-Settings button will take user to settings page

-View Requests will take user to requests page

- Create Group will take user to Create new Group Page

- Remove group will take the user to the remove group page
	options:
		user will stay on same page, and can "delete" the buttons that are there (think Apple iOS and deleting emails0
		user will be directed to a different page and choose which groups to remove (checklist) and come back to Main page where the removed group will be gone.

###Data:

The actual groups will be stored on device.
	Option: groups can be stored as a table on MySQL and queryed from app

This page needs to access whereever the above data is stored and display it on the Main Page.

The Grouplist portion of the main page should be scrollable if the user has more groups than the window can fit.

The settings, view requests, create group, and remove group buttons stay in place even if grouplist is scrollable.
	(i.e. when scrolling thru list, can still access buttons without having to scroll all the way back up or down)

Buttons as described in visual section should be correctly programmed to take user to appropriate pages..

********************************************************************************************
**Group View  --> 6
*********************************************************************************************
This is the page where the user views his or her groups.  This page is accessed from the Main Page.  In this page is a list of which contacts are in the group, the name of the group, a little box for sending messages, and a 
a send button.

###Visuals:

On the top of the window is a button in the corner labeled "+ Members".  On the opposite corner there is a button labeled "- Members" that does the reverse function.

In the middle of the application is the group name.

Under the group name is a scrollable portion that lists all of the contacts included in the group.
	The contact names are clickable and will open a new page with information about the contact.

There is a short message field at the bottom of the page - the user can enter a short message.

Under short message is a big send button that sends the message/request to the entire group.

- + Members button will take user to + Members Page

- - Members button will take user to - Members Page

- Clicking any group contact will open up a contact specific page containing his/her information.

- Send will send message, and question marks, check marks, or X marks will appear next to each contacts name to indicate response.

###Data:

The name of the group will be pulled from whereever "Groups" are stored, be it locally or serverside.

The group member list will be populated from the Group data.

Click on a member should open a new window, and their information should be populated in that new window.

Send message will pass the short message text field to the server.  The server will then forward 
the request and message to all contacts listed in the Group.  Those receiving the message will be given an option to respond.

After send message has been pressed, icons will appear next to Group contact names.
	Icons:
		Check - request was approved, proceed to contact
		X - request was denied, contact is not available
		Question Mark - contact has not responded to request.

After send message is pressed, it should either "gray out" to prevent another message being sent, or rename itself to "Send new message".
Clicking the button will send a new message, and the icons next to group contacts will change according to the newest request.
